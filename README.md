## General Info

Rock, Paper, Scissors is a game app completed as part of the The Odin Project. It is written in both HTML and JavaScript and is my first JavaScript project. The project demonstrates the skills learnt and reinforces skills previously aquired in areas including HTML & CSS, Git and GitHub.

The finished project has been taken slightly further than what was required so as to further test my knowledge and skills in the tech stack.

The game can be played via the following [link](https://approckpaperscissors.netlify.app/)
