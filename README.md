This is the second project work from The Odin Project introduction course that will test and further develop my understanding of JavaScript. The project will demonstrate these skills as well as reinforce previously aquired skills in areas such as using HTML & CSS, through the use of a code editor, Git and GitHub.
The finished project has been taken slightly further than those stated in the provided instructions and as a result has further tested my knowledge and skills.
